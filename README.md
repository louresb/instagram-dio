# Instagram homepage recreation 

In this project I recreated the Instagram login page.
I learned to use CSS with Flexbox, positioning elements in different orientations and alignments, and also media queries usage for responsiveness.

### Changes:

* Developed the page entirely in English
* I used Figma to create a mobile mockup with my own Instagram


\* It is not a totally identical clone, it was made for study purposes only.
