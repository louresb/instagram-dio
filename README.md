# Instagram homepage recreation 

In this project I recreated the Instagram login page.
I learned to use CSS with Flexbox, positioning elements in different positions and orientations on the page. I also practiced creating media queries for responsiveness. 

### ModificaÃ§Ãµes:

* Developed the page entirely in English
* I used Figma to create a mobile mockup with my own Instagram
